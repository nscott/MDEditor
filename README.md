# MDEditor

A very simple HTML5 markdown editor that lives in your browser.

Type in the left pane and content automatically saves itself to local storage.

The right pane dynamically refreshes as you type, or if you open a new tab and navigate back to the editor, it refreshes from storage.

This was a little side project I built that I like to make my new tab page in Firefox. Easy and fast to keep notes, and no internet connectivity needed.
